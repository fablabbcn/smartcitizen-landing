            <h2>The Smart Citizen Kit 2.0 is here!</h2>
            <p class="text-yellow">Gather information on your environment and make it available to everyone.</p>
            <p>Smart Citizen is a team of passionate people who believe data is critical to inform political participation at all levels. We develop tools for citizen action in environmental monitoring, and methodologies for community engagement and co-creation.  For the past three years, the Smart Citizen team has been working on an updated version of the Smart Citizen Kit. This new kit collects urban data more accurately and is easier to use.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h3>Connectivity</h3>
          <h4>wifi</h4>
          <p>The SCK 2.0 is designed to publish data using your home or office Wi-Fi. It currently supports most standard networks (b/g/n) with open, WEP or WPA/WPA2 authentication.</p>
          <p>WPA2 Enterprise networks not currently supported.</p>

          <h3>Storage</h3>
          <h4>Internal Memory</h4>
          <p>The SCK v2.0 includes an internal memory to store more than one week of data when the device loses its connectivity. Data is published automatically when the connection recovers.</p>
          <h4>SD Card</h4>
          <p>For operation in remote areas, it can store data in CSV format on an SD/SDHC MicroSD with a standard FAT file system. While in Wi-Fi mode when a card it is present it also stores the published data on the SD as a backup. Data can later be uploaded manually to the platform using the “Manual Data Upload” option.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h3>Power management</h3>
          <h4>Battery Lifetime</h4>
          <p>The SCK 2.0 comes with a 2000mAh LiPo battery. The battery is meant to be a complete power option for short-term measurements and a backup solution when the kit it is used for long periods. The battery lifetime depends extremely on the kind of sensors enabled or disabled:</p>
          <p>All the sensors publishing over Wi-Fi: 12 hrs.  All the sensors publishing on SD card: 13 hrs.  Without Air Quality Sensors over Wi-Fi: 10 days Without Air Quality Sensors on SD card: 25 days</p>
          <h4>Battery charging</h4>
          <p>The SCK 2.0 has a micro USB port and can be charged as any Smartphone or Tablet using a dedicated adapter or any computer USB port.  We recommend a Tablet power adaptor for the quick charging. Autonomy can be extended by using a Power Brick, a 5V PV Panel, or a through glass induction charger (currently under development).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h3>Configuration and updates</h3>
          <h4>Configuration</h4>
          <p>The online onboarding website guides you on the assembly and configuration process. You will need a computer with an internet connection to start using the SCK 2.0.</p>
          <h4>Software updates</h4>
          <p>The SCK 2.0 presents to a computer as a USB Storage device. A new firmware can be uploaded by simply downloading and dragging on top a new binary firmware release. The Wi-Fi module firmware is updated automatically over-the-air every time the main processor firmware it’s updated.</p>
